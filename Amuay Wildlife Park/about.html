                Amuay Wildlife Park is a nature reserve situated 350 km west of the
Venezuelan capital. The park's wide range of animal and plant life
extends over 72 km2 through varying grassland, hills, and marshes. The
Venezuelan government prohibits vehicular traffic through the area, other
than by scheduled tours along specified dirt tracks, to protect the
landscape, to protect visitors, and to preserve flora and fauna.

            <p>
                The Amuay Wildlife Park covers 630 hectares, 594 of which are dedicated to the conservation of flora and fauna, as well as the protection of the local hydrological basin. The other 36 hectares are developed and these areas consist of seven specific environments in which different species of animals are distributed in environments that seek to simulate their natural habitat.
